# Phaser 3 + Vite + Create React App template

I converted [Phase3+CRA](https://github.com/kevinshen56714/create-react-phaser3-app) template to support Vite. FYI. Vite is faster than webpack bundler. I hope you will save development time.

## What's included?

- [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) - overlaid canvas with the config in `src/PhaserGame.ts` and a scene in `src/scenes/`
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - React, TSX, ES6, TypeScript, Webpack, and etc, but this template will replace Webpack with Vite.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Faster bundler than Webpack which is default bundler of `Create React App`
- An example button in `src/App.tsx` showing how to communicate with Phaser within a React component
- That's it!

## Getting started

Clone the project and in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

Install required packages to run the app.

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
